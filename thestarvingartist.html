      <div id="textbox7">The starving artist poster the phrase “The Starving Artist,” refers to an artist not being able to make a living
        off their art. Society has come to expect artists to sell their work as if it was mass produced instead of handcrafted. For my
        piece, I wanted to create a poster that enforces the idea that value needs to once again be placed on artists and their artwork.
        I put the phrase, “the starving artist no more” to tell artists and art buyers that the idea of keeping an artist from truly making
        a living off their artwork needs to stop. Being a part of the art community, I am aware of how much time and effort it takes to
        create all types of different art pieces from ceramic to digital works. Artists most of the times have to disregard the funds it
        took to create art pieces that when they sell it they have to price it so people will be more willing to want to purchase the piece
        and as a result they either they just don’t make a profit or they don’t even make back the money that was invested to create it.
        The poster was created by a traditional letterpress the dimensions are slightly over 17in.x22in. The type used was letter wood blocks
       different inks were rolled onto each word before the paper was laid over the letters. The image of the photographer and the selling stand
       behind her were both designed in illustrator and then made into polymer plates. The polymer plates were stuck on to a medium sized metal
       block to be at the same height level as the letter woodblocks so the roller of the press would roll over everything that needed to be
       printed.
