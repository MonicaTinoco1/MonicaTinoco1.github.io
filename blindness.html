      <div id="textbox1">The Blindness series is influenced greatly by the horror movie genre and it represents the importance of sight
        for a practicing photographer and what would it mean if that person lost their eye-sight. A medium format film camera with black
        and white film was used to photograph the subject. I created thin circular sheets of latex just large enough to cover the
        circumference of the model's eyes. There was a makeup artist on set that was knowledgeable about using prosthetics and she helped
        make the latex blend onto the model’s face. The lighting used was one smith-victor light with barndoors placed on the left of the
        model. The barndoors were moderately close shut to reduce any harsh light on the model’s face or left side.</div>
