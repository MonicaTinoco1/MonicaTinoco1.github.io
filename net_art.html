      <div id="textbox13"> Net Art is an interactive game that was inspired by water pollution and how it has affected sea creatures
        but specifically sea turtles. The sea water continues to be polluted with discarded trash it is constantly being mistaken
        for food. Sea turtles eat jellyfish but with the water being overly polluted with plastic bags the turtle mistake the plastic
        bags for jellyfish.In the interactive game the player is asked to help the sea turtle find food and so the player then has to
        click on the animated jellyfish to find the jellyfish that is truly a jellyfish and not a plastic bag. Once the jellyfish is
        found the player can click on the information icon and be directed to a page that will provide information on the matter. On
        the bottom right corner there is a hyperlinked icon to a website for a sea turtle conservatory. The interactive game consists
        of 12 different linked pages that are a combination of vector images that were created in illustrator. The ocean background
        image was obtained by creative commons which I later added jellyfish to give dimension for the animated jellyfish gif. The
        jellyfish gif. was created in a pixel art website, so the motion of the jellyfish was created by adding and deleting pixels
        in multiple pixel pages and then was exported as a gif.
