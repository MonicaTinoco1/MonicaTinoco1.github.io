      <div id="textbox2">The Inglot album was a fictional client commission assignment. Three separate individuals were asked to pose for
        this fictional rock band. I chose to use animal masks to create the bandâ€™s individual aesthetic. The clothing worn on the models
        was their own. For typography, I chose a style that would add a grunge band's name and the overall album cover style as well. The
        back cover I created two options that were simplistic and complementary to the front cover. One of the back covers has just a
        centered list of songs with the copyright trademark information on the bottom. The other back cover has the list of songs wrapped
        around the centered band members masks.</div>
