      <div id="textbox6">Human trafficking is one of largest issues occuring right now all over the world. Children, women and men are
        all being trafficked. The project is a collage that is life size in dimensions with a thin plywood backing. The items that are in
        the collage represent the things that were used to entice the person to go with the trafficker whether it was a passport to
        another country or drugs if that person was an addict. There are also items to represent the things they are forced to endure
        such as physical beatings, neglect..etc. Instead of a face, a flower was placed to represent the many persons that are/were
        affected by this issue. The red acrylic paint that was brushed all over the image represents the violence and death.
