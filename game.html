      <div id="textbox5">The game, “The Masses” is a game greatly inspired by the recent shootings that have happened throughout the United
        States. The game touches on the idea of desensitizing and how its seen among people today towards mass shooting.  When in the game
        the player will be able to shoot the human model as well as the deer that was inserted in the game to further emphasize the reaction that the general public tends to have towards shootings as if it was deers shot during a hunt.The masses was created by reskinning an already existing game. The male avatar and the deers were added to the game as well as the textures. The screaming in the game was obtained by a creative commons site for sounds effects. The gun target to show where the gun was pointing was created in illustrator and then saved as a png to be added in the game’s code.
