			<p4>The game, “The Masses” is a game greatly inspired by the recent shootings that have happened throughout the United States. The game touches on the idea of desensitizing and how its seen among people today towards mass shooting.  When in the game the player will be able to shoot the human model as well as the deer that was inserted in the game to further emphasize the reaction that the general public tends to have towards shootings as if it was deers shot during a hunt.
