      <div id="textbox8">The mailer was created using a black and white photograph that I took and was printed as a 3in.x3in. reversed
        colored image on an inkjet printer. The paper used was fabriano with deckled edges. The paper was coated with a transfer medium
        in the area that the revered image was going to be placed. Once the image was placed it was left to dry for a few hours. After the
        transfer medium was dry the entire paper was put in a tray of cold water and left to soak for a few minutes so it would be easier
        to rub off the copy paper and reveal the correctly faced  image. The paper was then set on a drying rack overnight so the paper
        completely dried. The letterpress was used for the lettering on the back of the mailer. The type used was Bodoni regular. A polymer
        plate needed to be created for the logo that was embossed on the front of the mail. The logo was designed in illustrator.
