      <div id="textbox10">The Dia de los Muertos poster represents the day of the dead which is a large part of Mexican culture and
        it's to celebrate the deceased by making altars that relatives’ photographs can be placed on. Food is also placed as an offering
        on the altar specifically foods the deceased relatives’ enjoyed to eat. The poster has marigold flowers which are the flowers that
         are used for the celebration placed on the deceased grave site and on the altars. The poster was created in illustrator and
         photoshop.
