      <div id="textbox3">The Michelle album was a fictional client commission assignment. The model was asked to pose as a Blues artist
        for the album cover. The choice of lighting was one smith-victor light with barndoors. There was also a blue filter attached to
        the barndoors to give the impression of soft blue light. The typography is vertical and placed at the left of the cover beside
        the leaning model. The back cover was set up to have the artistâ€™s instrument and her hat resting on the open case. The typography
        was placed on the left of the back cover listing the song names.</div>
